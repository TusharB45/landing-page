How to use:
1) Replace Formspree endpoint in contact.html and landing.html (search for YOUR_FORM_ID).
2) Upload all files to your GitHub repo connected to Vercel.
3) Keep /landing.html for ads; Google should use the /landing URL.
4) Add your own og-image.jpg and tushar.jpg to your deployment root for rich previews.
5) Update phone/email in footer() in all pages if needed.
